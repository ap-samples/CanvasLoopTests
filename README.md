CanvasLoopTests
===============

Testing the new 'requestAnimationFrame' performance vs. the old 'setInterval'.

There're lots of talks about the need to use requestAnimationFrame just **always** instead
of old setInterval or setTimeout. You can see for yourself if it's true using these examples.
Navigate to *index.html* page and start exploring the tests.

*Spoiler:* as of 24.06.2014 all animations in latest FF/Chromium are not smooth using either method.
